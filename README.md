# Treasure-Hunt-Game
This program is a small game that has hidden bombs and treasure along with a path of variable distance. The game requires the player to enter move location commands to reveal what is hidden at a given position along with the path. The object of the game is for the player to find as many treasures as possible before running out of moves or lives. Discovering a bomb will reduce the player’s life count. Discovering a treasure will earn the player treasure points. Discovering both, a treasure with a bomb in the same location, will reduce the player’s life count and earn the player treasure points (a life insurance payout). Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to perform some upfront configurations to the player and the game components; These settings will define how the game is played.
